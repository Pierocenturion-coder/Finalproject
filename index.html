  <br>The Stanley Parable is my favorite game because it feels less like a story I’m playing and more like a conversation I’m having with the game itself. As Stanley, I walk through an empty office while a narrator calmly explains what I am “supposed” to do. Every time I choose whether to obey or resist, it feels personal, like the game is testing my sense of control. The humor makes the experience enjoyable, but it is also unsettling in how it exposes how often I follow instructions without thinking. Repetition becomes meaningful rather than boring, as each ending reflects something different about choice and freedom. The game constantly reminds me that player agency is complicated, and that realization is what keeps me coming back.</br>
